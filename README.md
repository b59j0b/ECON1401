Course Details  Outcomes 
Course Description 
This course will engage you with the founding ideas of economics and their relevance to the social   usefulness   of   modern   economic   science.    You   will   participate   in   active   refection   and debate about the discipline’s objectives and approaches as they have developed through history and as they relate to other social science and business disciplines. You will learn how   modern-day   problems   are   addressed   in   different   subfelds   of   modern   economics,   how   these   endeavours relate   to   the   historical   development   of   economics, and   where   the   frontiers   of   economics   as   a discipline presently   lie.
Course Aims 
The aims of the course are:
1. To prepare students to undertake advanced undergraduate study in economics   grounded   in   a   broad   understanding   of   the   place   of   the   discipline   in   history   and   society.
2. To develop students’ awareness of the breadth, universality, and frontiers of the concerns   addressed   by   economists.
3. To develop students’ expressive abilities in both spoken and written form.
Relationship to Other Courses 
ECON1401 is required to betaken by all students in the   Bachelor of   Economics   program,   usually   late in their frst year (ideally) or in the early part of their second year. Students are strongly discouraged from waiting until   their fnal year to take ECON1401. ECON1401 is not a pre-requisite for other courses, but the School of Economics strongly recommends that ECON1401 betaken   by   students   early   in   their   program   of   study   because   its   content   informs   the   selection   of higher-level   courses   and   builds   conceptual   frameworks   into   which   content   from   later   courses can be   placed.In   addition   to   assuming   basic   competence   in   English   and   mathematics   taken   from   highschool,      ECON1401 builds on material contained in ECON1101   Microeconomics   1. This   pre-requisite will   beenforced.

Learning and Teaching in this course 
Lectures
Lectures   in   Weeks   1 - 4 will   focus   on   concepts   pertaining   to   microeconomics, while   those   in Weeks 5, 7, 8, and 9 will focus on concepts pertaining to macroeconomics.   Material   in   both sections is organised around big ideas in economics, the times and thinkers giving rise to them,   and how they are used today in understanding and approaching socioeconomic   problems and disciplinary   frontiers. Lectures   in   both   sections   will   provide   guidance   in   how   to   think, evaluate arguments and evidence, and produce work in line with the standards of modern   economic   science.
Lectures will contain a mix of lecture material delivery and QA time within the lecture.
Tutorials
Tutorials are an integral part of this course and will beheld for   1.5 hours   each week,   except   in week 6. Please note that unlike many other courses, tutorials for this course start in Week   1. All tutorial   streams   will   beheld   face-to-face   on   campus.
Tutorial   discussions   and   activities   will   be   extremely   hands-on, structured   on   a “fipping   the classroom” model and building on material that students have prepared. You should   attend tutorials having done the week's readings. There is free and easy access to electronic or hardcopy   versions   of   both   textbooks   and   all   assigned   readings   and   associated   materials   for each week. Tutorials in some weeks will include pre-announced debates about economic policy,   for   which   preparation   will   be   required   before   class.
